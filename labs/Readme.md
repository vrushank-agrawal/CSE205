  These are my lab solutions for the Computer Architecture Course.
  
  For those concerned about grading, I got the following grades for each lab:
  - Unix: 25/30
  - Data: 48/57
  - Calc: 97/100
  - Arch: 165/170
  - Bomb: 60/70     (There is a secret phase that I did not figure out but you should to get a 70)
  - Attack: 100/100
  - Malloc: 65/65
  - Cache: 60/60
